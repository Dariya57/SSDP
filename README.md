1. Strategy Pattern: Payment Processing System
Problem:
The e-commerce platform needs to handle different payment methods (e.g., Credit Card, PayPal, Cryptocurrency) dynamically without modifying the payment processing code.
Solution:
The Strategy Pattern allows defining a family of payment strategies, encapsulating each one, and making them interchangeable at runtime.

2. Observer Pattern: Weather Monitoring System
Problem:
Multiple weather displays need to update automatically when weather data changes.
Solution:
The Observer Pattern allows the WeatherStation to notify all registered displays (observers) whenever the weather data changes.

3. Command Pattern: Smart Home Remote Control
Problem:
A universal remote control should operate various smart home devices (e.g., TV, lights, stereo) and provide undo functionality.
Solution:
The Command Pattern allows encapsulating requests (e.g., turning on/off devices) as objects. This provides the flexibility to issue commands and revert actions.

4. State Pattern: Order Processing System
Problem:
An online store's order needs to change behavior based on its current state (e.g., New, Paid, Shipped, Delivered, Canceled).
Solution:
The State Pattern encapsulates the states of an order and delegates specific actions (pay, ship, deliver, cancel) to the current state.

5. Chain of Responsibility: Expense Approval System
Problem:
Expenses should be approved by different levels of employees (TeamLead, Manager, Director, CEO) based on the amount.
Solution:
The Chain of Responsibility pattern processes expense requests by passing them through a chain of approvers until one can handle the request.

6. Mediator Pattern: Chat Room Application
Problem:
A chat application should allow users to send messages to each other through a central mediator.
Solution:
The Mediator Pattern centralizes communication between users, reducing direct dependencies between the participants.

7. Memento Pattern: Document Version Control System
Problem:
A document editor needs to allow users to save and restore different versions of a document.
Solution:
The Memento Pattern captures and stores the document's state and allows restoring it later.

8. Visitor Pattern: Shape Area Calculator
Problem:
The system should be able to calculate the area of different shapes using a consistent approach without modifying the shape classes.
Solution:
The Visitor Pattern defines an external AreaCalculator that visits shape objects to calculate their areas.

9. Template Method Pattern: Report Generation System
Problem:
A report generation system needs to produce different formats (e.g., PDF, HTML) while following a consistent process.
Solution:
The Template Method Pattern defines the structure of the report generation process, with subclasses handling specific formats.

10. Iterator Pattern: Playlist Management System
Problem:
A music streaming service needs to allow users to traverse playlists in different orders (sequential, shuffle, filtered by genre).
Solution:
The Iterator Pattern defines multiple iterators to traverse a playlist in different ways.
